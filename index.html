          <p>Sir Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton MBE HonFREng (born 7 January 1985) is a British racing driver. He
            currently competes in
            Formula One for Mercedes, having previously driven for McLaren from 2007 to 2012. In Formula One, Hamilton
            has won a
            joint-record seven World Drivers' Championship titles (tied with Michael Schumacher), and holds the records
            for the most
            wins (99), pole positions (101), and podium finishes (173), amongst others.</p>

          <p>
            Born and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton was signed to the McLaren young driver programme in
            1998. This led
            to a Formula One drive with McLaren in 2007, making Hamilton the first, and so far only, black driver to
            race in the
            series. That season, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi Räikkönen by one point.
            The
            following season, he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion – making a crucial overtake on the last corner
            of the last
            lap in the last race of the season – to become the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history.
            After four more
            years with McLaren, Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013.

          <p>Hamilton is regarded as one of the most complete drivers on the grid, excelling across a wide range of
            areas. He has
            been described as having an aggressive driving style with a natural aptitude for identifying the limits of
            the car. Mark
            Hughes, writing for the official Formula One website, described how Hamilton is "super-hard on the brakes,
            but has a
            fantastic ability to match how quickly the downforce is bleeding off with his modulation of the pressure so
            that there's
            no wasted grip but no locked wheels either." Paddy Lowe, previously the engineering director for McLaren,
            described how
            Hamilton is comfortable with levels of rear instability that most other drivers would find intolerable.
            Hamilton has
            also been praised for his ability to adapt to variances in the car set-up and changing track conditions;
            throughout his
            career, he has typically used less fuel than his teammates as a result of his ability to carry momentum
            through corners
            despite instability in the car.</p>
